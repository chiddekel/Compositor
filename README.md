# Compositor

Adobe Photoshop costs too much and tools like GIMP don’t feel familiar enough for me to stay in flow. That’s why I built Compositor.

The goal was to create a full-featured image editor that is completely free and open source. I use Photoshop for compositing and post-processing, so Compositor is built around that workflow - with the tools needed to create a pixel-perfect final image.

Because it’s open source, you can download the Xcode project and add, remove, or modify any feature to fit your workflow.

## Features

### Layers
- Layers and folders, with blend modes and opacity
- Layer masks: paint, fill, invert, blur and feather them; link or unlink them to transform a mask on its own
- Clipping masks and folder masks
- Adjustment layers: Hue/Saturation, Levels, Curves, Exposure, Gradient Map and Grain
- Merge Down, Merge Layers and Merge Group (⌘E)
- Duplicate, rename inline, reorder and nest by drag and drop; Option-drag to duplicate
- Drag layers between open projects

### Transform
- Non-destructive move, scale, rotate and flip — images keep their full resolution however small you make them
- Free distort (⌘-drag a handle), with Shift to lock to an axis
- Transform several layers, or a whole folder, together
- Snapping to canvas and layer edges and centers, with guides
- Exact values for position, size, scale and angle, stepped with the arrow keys
- Flip Layer and Flip Canvas, horizontal and vertical

### Selections
- Rectangle and Ellipse Marquee, Freehand and Polygonal Lasso, and Magic Wand
- Add to and subtract from selections, move the outline, or move and duplicate the pixels inside
- Load a layer's pixels or a mask as a selection
- Content-Aware Fill, which can also extend an image past its edges

### Painting and retouching
- Brush with size, hardness and opacity, and Shift for straight lines
- Spot Healing Brush (content-aware)
- Clone Stamp, aligned or not, sampling one layer or all of them
- Blur tool, on pixels or masks
- Gradient tool and Shape tool (rectangles, rounded rectangles and ellipses)
- Eyedropper and a full color picker

### Adjustments and filters
- Levels (with Auto), Curves, Hue/Saturation, Exposure, Gradient Map, Grain and Invert
- Gaussian Blur and Motion Blur that spread past a layer's edges
- Add Noise, Lens Correction and Remove Background
- Live previews, limited to the selection when there is one

### Canvas and files
- Multiple projects in tabs
- Crop with snapping, and Option for symmetric cropping
- Canvas Size and Image Size
- Sharp high-quality downsampling when zoomed out, and a pixel grid when zoomed in
- Import JPEG, PNG, HEIC and TIFF — including dropped screenshots and images from other apps
- Export JPEG with a live preview (⇧⌥⌘S); Copy Merged
- Photoshop-style keyboard shortcuts throughout

## Requirements

- macOS 26
- Xcode 26 (to build from source)

## Building

Open `Compositor.xcodeproj` and run the **Compositor** scheme.

### Linux (Flatpak)

The Linux port builds entirely inside the Flatpak SDK sandbox — it never links
the build host's installed system libraries. Qt6 comes from the KDE SDK (6.10),
Swift from the `swift6` SDK extension (Freedesktop 25.08 branch, Swift 6.3.3), and
Skia + OpenCV are vendored as pinned Flatpak modules compiled into `/app`.

Install the runtime, SDK, and Swift extension (one-time):

```
flatpak install --user flathub \
    org.kde.Platform//6.10 org.kde.Sdk//6.10 \
    org.freedesktop.Sdk.Extension.swift6//25.08
```

Build and install the app:

```
flatpak-builder --user --install --force-clean build-dir \
    com.wonderassembly.Compositor.yaml
```

Run:

```
flatpak run com.wonderassembly.Compositor
```

Headless smoke test (no display):

```
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen flatpak run com.wonderassembly.Compositor --help
```

Local development (build from the working tree inside the sandbox):

```
flatpak-builder --run build-dir com.wonderassembly.Compositor.yaml bash
# inside the sandbox:
export PATH=/usr/lib/sdk/swift6/bin:$PATH
swift build -c release --static-swift-stdlib
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/app \
    -DQt6_DIR=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/Qt6 \
    -DOpenCV_DIR=/app/lib/cmake/opencv4 \
    -DCompositorCore_SWIFT_STATIC_LIB=$PWD/.build/release/libCompositorCore.a
cmake --build build
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

The Skia and OpenCV source archives are not committed to the repo; `flatpak-builder`
fetches and verifies them (pinned `sha256` in the manifest) at build time.
Provenance records live in `third_party/skia.pinned` and `third_party/opencv.pinned`.

## Releasing

`scripts/release.sh` builds a Release version, signs it with Developer ID, notarizes and staples it, and packages it into `dist/Compositor-<version>.dmg`.

It needs, all kept outside this repository:

- a **Developer ID Application** certificate in the login keychain
- notarization credentials saved with `xcrun notarytool store-credentials "compositor-notary" …`
- [`create-dmg`](https://github.com/create-dmg/create-dmg) (`brew install create-dmg`)
