/*
 * Compositor C ABI — versioned seam between the retained Swift core and the
 * Qt/C++ host (see docs/linux-port-plan.md, ENG-1).
 *
 * Canonical buffer contract:
 *   - 8-bit premultiplied RGBA, sRGB, in byte order R,G,B,A.
 *   - Explicit `stride` (bytes per row); rows are `stride` bytes apart, not
 *     necessarily `width*4`. Every C-kernel entry asserts stride >= width*4
 *     and that buffers are premultiplied (ENG-17).
 *   - Separate 8-bit grayscale coverage, one byte per pixel, row stride = width.
 *   - Committed tiles are immutable; callers must not mutate a tile in flight.
 *
 * ABI versioning: `@_cdecl` is an unofficial, Swift-version-sensitive attribute.
 * The Swift toolchain version is pinned in the versioned-ABI contract
 * (Package.swift swiftLanguageMode + the Freedesktop Swift runtime extension).
 * Bumping the toolchain is an ABI-affecting change.
 *
 * Status codes:
 *   0  success
 *  -1  invalid argument (bad geometry, NULL required buffer, out-of-range size)

/* Stateful editor ABI v1. One handle owns one document, transient edits, and
 * history. Calls are serialized per handle. Close invalidates the ID; IDs are
 * never reused. No Swift/Qt callbacks occur while a session lock is held.
 *
 * Commands are bounded UTF-8 JSON: {"version":1,"action":"new","width":64,
 * "height":64}. See docs/abi.md for commands and ownership. Input is copied.
 * Status: 0 success, -1 invalid input, -2 no document, -3 busy,
 * -4 unsupported version, -5 operation failed, -6 invalid/closed handle.
 *
 * state/render return required byte count or a negative status. A NULL or short
 * output buffer is not written. Query size, allocate, then call again with the
 * capacity. JSON is NOT NUL-terminated. Render returns tightly packed RGBA8
 * premultiplied sRGB, with dimensions from state. The caller owns all buffers.
